# `liana`: Intro

The continuous developments of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) have sparked an
immense interest in understanding intercellular crosstalk. Multiple tools and
resources that aid the investigation of cell-cell communication (CCC) were 
published recently. However, these methods and resources are usually in a fixed
combination of a tool and its corresponding resource, but in principle any
resource could be combined with any method.

To this end, we built `liana` - a framework to decouple the tools from their
corresponding resources.

## LIANA's development continous as LIANA+

We recommend all users to consider using [LIANA+](https://liana-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), instead of LIANA, due to it's increased efficiency and completeness.
We plan to eventually port all LIANA+ functionalities and backend to R, but in the meantime [LIANA+ in Python](https://liana-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is recommended.


## Load required packages
```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(liana)
```

## CCC Resources
`liana` provides CCC resources obtained and formatted via [`OmnipathR`](https://github.com/saezlab/OmnipathR) which are then converted to the appropriate format to each method.
```{r liana_resource, warning = FALSE}
# Resource currently included in OmniPathR (and hence `liana`) include:
show_resources()

# A list of resources can be obtained using the `select_resource()` function:
# See `?select_resource()` documentation for further information.
# select_resource(c('OmniPath')) %>% dplyr::glimpse() 
```
  
  
## CCC Methods
Each of the resources can then be run with any of the following methods:
```{r liana_method, warning = FALSE}
# Resource currently included in OmniPathR (and hence `liana`) include:
show_methods()
```
Note that the different algorithms (or scoring measures) used in `sca`, `natmi`,
`connectome`, `cellphonedb`, `cytotalk`'s crosstalk scores, and `logfc` were re-implemented in LIANA.
Yet, the original method pipelines can be called via the `call_*` functions.

## `liana` wrapper function

To run `liana`, we will use a down-sampled toy *HUMAN* PBMCs scRNA-Seq data set, obtained from [SeuratData](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data).

`liana` takes `Seurat` and `SingleCellExperiment` objects as input, containing processed counts and clustered cells.
```{r load_data}
liana_path <- system.file(package = "liana")
testdata <-
  readRDS(file.path(liana_path , "testdata", "input", "testdata.rds"))

testdata %>% dplyr::glimpse()
```

`liana_wrap` calls a number of methods and and each method is run with the provided resource(s).

We will now call all methods that are currently available in liana.

Here we use only the `Consensus` (Default) CCC resource, but any of the 
aforementioned ones (available via `show_resources()`) can be added to the `resource` parameter
```{r liana_run, message = FALSE, print = FALSE, results='hide'}
# Run liana
liana_test <- liana_wrap(testdata)

# Liana returns a list of results, each element of which corresponds to a method
liana_test %>% dplyr::glimpse()
```
LIANA currently provides a mixture of re-implemented methods and pipelines which externally call specific LR methods.
By default, LIANA will call *only the internal scoring function*, i.e. those that are re-implemented in LIANA.

One can use LIANA to also run the original methods.
For more about the original methods see [LIANA++](https://saezlab.github.io/liana/articles/liana_devel.html).


## Aggregate and Obiain Consensus Ranks
`liana` also provides consensus ranks for the results obtained using different
methods. By default, `liana` will provide mean, median, and aggregate* consensus
ranks
```{r liana_ranks, warning=FALSE}
# We can aggregate these results into a tibble with consensus ranks
liana_test <- liana_test %>%
  liana_aggregate()

dplyr::glimpse(liana_test)
```

Voila! That's it. A very brief intro to LIANA and how to obtain the scoring functions†
for each method implemented in it, as well as an aggregate_rank* which serves as a consensus across methods.

(†) Note that here we focus on the scores recommended to be used to prioritize interaction in a 
single sample system. Most of these, with the exception of SingleCellSignalR's LRscore, take
the specificity of the cluster pair into account.

(*) The aggregate consensus rank (`aggregate_rank`) is obtained using a re-implementation of the [`RRA`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278763/) method from the `RobustRankAggreg` package.

`RRA` scores can be interpreted as p-values and interactions which are
ranked consistently higher than random are assigned low scores/p-values.

## Simple DotPlot

We will now plot the results. By default, we use the `LRscore` from SingleCellSignalR
to represent the magnitude of expression of the ligand and receptor, and NATMI's `specificity weights`
to show how specific a given interaction is to the `source`(L) and `target`(R) cell types.

Note that the top 20 interactions (`ntop`), are defined as unique ligand-receptors 
ordered consequentially, regardless of the cell types. Done subsequent to filtering to the `source_groups` and `target_groups` of interest. In this case, we plot interactions in which B cells are the `source` (express the ~ligands) and the other 3 cell types are the `target` cell types (those which express the ~receptors).

By default, `liana_aggregate` would order LIANA's 
output according to `rank_aggregate` in ascending order. 

Note that using `liana_dotplot` /w `ntop` assumes that liana's results are 
ranked accordingly! Refer to `rank_method`, if you wish to easily rank
interactions for a single method (see example below).

```{r liana_dotplot, warning=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=8}
liana_test %>%
  liana_dotplot(source_groups = c("B"),
                target_groups = c("NK", "CD8 T", "B"),
                ntop = 20)
```

Note that missing dots are interactions which are not expressed in at least 10% of the cells (by default)
in both cell clusters.

In this case, we consider the specificity of interactions as defined by 
[NATMI's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18873-z) edge specificity weights. 
NATMI's specificity edges range from 0 to 1, where `1` means both the ligand
and receptor are uniquely expressed in a given pair of cells. 
Expression magnitude, represented by [SingleCellExperiment's LRScore](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/10/e55/5810485), is on the other hand, 
meant to represent a non-negative regularized score, comparable between datasets.


## Frequency Heatmap
We will now plot the frequencies of interactions for each pair of *potentially* communicating cell types.

This heatmap was inspired by CellChat's and CellPhoneDB's heatmap designs.

First, we filter interactions by `aggregate_rank`, which can itself
 be treated as a p-value of for the robustly, highly ranked interactions.
Nevertheless, one can also filter according to [CPDB's p-value](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0292-x) (<=0.05) or
[SingleCellExperiments LRScore](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/10/e55/5810485), etc.

```{r heatfreq, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
liana_trunc <- liana_test %>%
   # only keep interactions concordant between methods
  filter(aggregate_rank <= 0.01) # note that these pvals are already corrected

heat_freq(liana_trunc)
```

Here, we see that `NK`-`CD8 T` share a relatively large number of the inferred
interactions, with many of those being send from `NK` - note large sum of 
interactions (gray barplot) in which NK is the `Sender`.

**NB!** Here, an assumption is implied that the number of interactions inferred between
cell types is informative of the communication events occurring in the system.
This is a rather strong assumption that one should consider prior to making any 
conclusions. [Our suggestion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.21.445160v1.abstract) is that any conclusions should be complimented with further information, such as biological prior knowledge, spatial information, etc.


## Frequency Chord diagram

Here, we will generate a chord diagram equivalent to the frequencies heatmap.

First, make sure you have the `circlize` package installed.
```{r cricl, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE}
if(!require("circlize")){
  install.packages("circlize", quiet = TRUE,
                   repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
}
```

In this case, one could choose the source and target cell type groups that they wish to plot.
```{r chordfreq, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
p <- chord_freq(liana_trunc,
                source_groups = c("CD8 T", "NK", "B"),
                target_groups = c("CD8 T", "NK", "B"))
```


For more advanced visualization options, we kindly refer the user to [SCpubr](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/) (see [`SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()`](https://enblacar.github.io/SCpubr-book-v1/21-LigandReceptorPlot.html)).


## Run any method of choice.

We will now run only the CellPhoneDB's permutation-based algorithm.
We will also lower the number of permutations that we wish to perform for the sake of computational time.
Note that one can also parallelize the CPDB algorithm implemented in LIANA (in this case we don't,
as this would only make sense when working with large datasets).

Also, here we will use a `SingleCellExperiment` object as input. In reality, LIANA converts `Seurat` objects
to SingleCellExperiment and is to a large extend based on the BioConductor single-cell infrastructure.

```{r cpdb_test, message = FALSE, print = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=9}
# Load Sce testdata
sce <- readRDS(file.path(liana_path , "testdata", "input", "testsce.rds"))

# RUN CPDB alone
cpdb_test <- liana_wrap(sce,
                        method = 'cellphonedb',
                        resource = c('CellPhoneDB'),
                        permutation.params = list(nperms=100,
                                                  parallelize=FALSE,
                                                  workers=4),
                        expr_prop=0.05)

# identify interactions of interest
cpdb_int <- cpdb_test %>%
  # only keep interactions with p-val <= 0.05
  filter(pvalue <= 0.05) %>% # this reflects interactions `specificity`
  # then rank according to `magnitude` (lr_mean in this case)
  rank_method(method_name = "cellphonedb",
              mode = "magnitude") %>%
  # keep top 20 interactions (regardless of cell type)
  distinct_at(c("ligand.complex", "receptor.complex")) %>%
  head(20)



# Plot toy results
cpdb_test %>%
  # keep only the interactions of interest
  inner_join(cpdb_int, 
             by = c("ligand.complex", "receptor.complex")) %>%
  # invert size (low p-value/high specificity = larger dot size)
  # + add a small value to avoid Infinity for 0s
  mutate(pvalue = -log10(pvalue + 1e-10)) %>% 
  liana_dotplot(source_groups = c("c"),
                target_groups = c("c", "a", "b"),
                specificity = "pvalue",
                magnitude = "lr.mean",
                show_complex = TRUE,
                size.label = "-log10(p-value)")
```


## SingleCellSignalR, CytoTalk, NATMI, and Connectome scores /w Complexes
The re-implementation of the aforementioned methods in LIANA enables us to make use of 
multimeric complex information as provided by the e.g. CellPhoneDB, CellChatDB, and ICELLNET resources

```{r complex_test, message = FALSE, print = FALSE}
# Run liana re-implementations with the CellPhoneDB resource
complex_test <- liana_wrap(testdata,
                           method = c('natmi', 'sca', 'logfc'),
                           resource = c('CellPhoneDB'))

complex_test %>% liana_aggregate()
```


## Call `liana` with overwritten default settings
By default `liana` is run with the default for each method which can be obtained via `liana_default()`

Alternatively, one can also overwrite the default settings by simply passing them to the liana wrapper function
```{r liana_params, message = FALSE, print = FALSE}
# define geometric mean
geometric_mean <- function(vec){exp(mean(log(vec)))}

# Overwrite default parameters by providing a list of parameters
liana_test <- liana_wrap(testdata,
                         method = c('cellphonedb', 'sca'),
                         resource = 'Consensus',
                         permutation.params = 
                           list(
                             nperms = 10 # here we run cpdb it only with 10 permutations
                             ),
                         complex_policy="geometric_mean"
                         )

# This returns a list of results for each method
liana_test %>% dplyr::glimpse()
```
Note that with `liana_call.params` one can change the way that we account for complexes.
By default this is set to the mean of the subunits in the complex (as done for expression in CellPhoneDB/Squidpy), 
and it would return the subunit closest to the mean. 

Here we change it to the geometric_mean, but any alternative function can be passed and other 
perfectly viable approaches could also include e.g. the Trimean of CellChat.
  
Please refer to the `?liana_wrap` documentation for more information on all the parameters that can be tuned in liana. Also, one can obtain a list with all default parameters by calling the `liana_defaults()` function.
